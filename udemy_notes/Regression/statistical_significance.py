# P value for any scenario

#A coin is tossed up in the air,   probablity either way is 0.5 or 50%

# h0 = A fair coin,          h1 = A not so fair coin



#P-value
#<editor-fold desc="statistical_significance">
# Probability of getting a tail:
# 1st toss: 0.5
# 2nd toss = 0.25
# 3rd toss = 0.12
# 4th toss = 0.06
# This is the line of significance, if less than 5 %, then the coin is surely rigged
# 5th toss = 0.03
